I'm a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. Prior to joining University of Virginia in 2024, I earned my Master's degree in Medical Robotics from Johns Hopkins University and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Virginia Tech. My research focuses on Computer-Integrated Surgical Robotics, Medical Image Analysis, and Augmented/Virtual Reality for Surgerical Navigation.
