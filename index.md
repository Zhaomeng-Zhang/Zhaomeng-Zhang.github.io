I'm a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia and currently working with Prof. [Homa Alemzadeh](https://homa-alem.github.io/index.html). Prior to joining University of Virginia in 2024, I earned my Master's degree in Medical Robotics from [Johns Hopkins University](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/) and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Virginia Tech](https://ece.vt.edu/). My research mainly focuses on Computer-Integrated Surgical Robotics, Medical Image Analysis, and Augmented/Virtual Reality for Surgerical Navigation.
