**1. Augmented Reality Based Tooth Preparation Training System**

The objective of this project is to develop a training system for tooth drilling while providing real-time force feedback by using haptic device and visualizing digital tooth on HoloLen2. This implementation aims to make surgeons familiarize the tooth preparation steps for the installation of a custom-made dental crown.
