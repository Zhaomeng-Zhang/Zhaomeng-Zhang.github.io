**1. Augmented Reality(AR) Based Tooth Preparation Training System**

Tooth preparation is a surgical procedure in which dentists utilize a drilling tool to remove enamel and dentin, making the tooth the desired shape for the subsequent placement of a crown or bridge. In practice, tooth preparation involves four steps: creating the occlusal surfaces, reducing the buccal surfaces, cutting half of the lingual surfaces, and smoothing these surfaces. The standard depth requirement for occlusal and buccal reduction should fall within a range of approximately 1 mm to 1.5 mm. Excessive drilling poses the risk of damaging the pulp and causing inflammation, while inadequate drilling may result in an improper fit for the crown size. 

To accurately complete these steps of tooth preparation, dentists must possess highly delicate surgical skills and engage in long-term practice.The objective of this project is to develop a training system for tooth drilling while providing real-time force feedback by using haptic device and visualizing digital tooth on AR Headset HoloLens2. This implementation aims to make surgeons familiarize the tooth preparation steps for the installation of a custom-made dental crown.
